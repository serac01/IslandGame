## Introduction
This program was created for the subject of Object Oriented Programming, in the Computer Engineering Degree (European Course), at ISEC. <br>
A construction and development simulator/game (single-player) is intended to be built in C++. The player will be granted an island and the player must develop this island, industrializing it and building an entire manufacturing complex.
 
 
  ## QT
  
 Qt is a framework for developing graphical interfaces in C++. With it, it is possible to develop applications once and compile them for different platforms without having to change the source code. In this project I used QT Widgets in CLion.
